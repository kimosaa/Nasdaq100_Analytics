🚀 Key Features
1. Market Overview Dashboard
Real-time Price Tracking: Live NASDAQ 100 price movements with interactive charts

Performance Metrics: Total returns, annualized performance, and volatility measures

Key Statistics: Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, best/worst day performance

Return Distribution Analysis: Histogram visualization of daily returns

2. Technical Analysis
Moving Averages: 20-day, 50-day, and 200-day moving averages

Relative Strength Index (RSI): Overbought/oversold indicators with visual alerts

Bollinger Bands: Volatility-based trading bands with price containment analysis

Technical Signals: Real-time buy/sell/hold recommendations

3. Risk Analysis & Management
